Hello and welcome to the Repository of OSCL (Overly Simplified Coding Langauge)!

Our coding language consists of basic functions

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ?                    | String, Bool, Interger |
| #                    | Interger               |
| (Function)           | Insert Function        |

**OSCL (Overly Simplified Coding Langauge) V1.0**

| Function Name | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Let ? = ?           | Variable   |
| Repeat # (Function) | Repeat     |
| Add # #             | Adds       |
| Sub # #             | Subtracts  |
| Mul # #             | Multiplies |
| Div # #             | Divides    |

We will never be updating this language ever again unless for some reason I got bored (Like, SUPER SUPER bored)
